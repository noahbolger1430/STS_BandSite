# STS_BandSite
Band website for Small-Town Strip Club

## Purpose 

The purpose of this site is to draw interest to our band, Small Town Strip Club. This will be a portal for band members write blog posts, upload photos and make announcements with regards to shows and music. Further, this site will be a sandbox to practice design concepts, frameworks, and features of various languages. 

## Pages

This seciton will explain and quirks and features within the site as well as the purpose for each page.

### Login

The login page only allows a user to login, there is no way to create a user form the login page. This is desired functionality as currently, only band members should have login access. 
Eventually (depending on band growth) users will be able to login and edit email settings to get email updates, and event notifications. 

### Music

The music page features a built in spotify widget that displays a playlist of current covers that the band plays. This seciton will eventually feature a large widget for artist inspiration where band members can write posts about artists that inspire their music.
This page will also link to other local band's websites and social media pages ot generate interest around local music, as well as connect the band with local musicians. 

### Blog

The blog page will feature a blog entry form for band members, and a blog feed on the main site. This will be able to display attachments, audio, video, and text posts made by members. 

### Announcements

The announcements page is used as a temporary blog to announce upcoming shows and events. This page is static and will have to be updated through the HTML.

### Practice Metrics

This page will hopefully make use of tablature and lyric API's to curate custom practice pages for each band member. This page will track progress by displaying avg practice time per session and other possibly useful metrics.
